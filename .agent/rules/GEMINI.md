If I ask you to make a plan or to do list I mean Act like a superstar Product Designer and come up with a DETAILED PRODUCT SPECIFICATION and IMPLEMENTATION PLAN of the work that needs to be done and the best way to do it considering the existing project structure. Read up and make sure you have a comprehensive understanding of systems you are changing, including things that may interfere with changes you want to make. Prefer to make smaller targeted edits where possible but don't shy away from big plans where required.
